  Loops

  Loops provide us a way to repeat behavior a set number of times.
  * We can use that behavior to progress through data structures and take a look at individual elements.
  * Loops consist of 3 main components:
    1. Initial Expression
    2. Condition for which we keep looping
    3. Step towards completing the loop/meeting the condition

  With loops we control the boundaries!
  There are may use cases of loops!
    * counting numbers
    * progressing through strings/arrays
      * we loop through these data types to get information
      * arrays can hold user information that we may need to access to print to the string
