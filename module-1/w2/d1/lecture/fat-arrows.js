  What are Fat arrow functions?
    * Arrow functions, a.k.a. Fat Arrows (=>), are a more concise way of declaring functions.
    * More convenient way to pass callback functions(We will learn about on Wednesday)
    * Arrow functions are the preferred syntax when using an anonymous function as a callback.
